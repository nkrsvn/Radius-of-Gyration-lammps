File 44000_2.data contain topology and potential data for 6 PMMA chain heated to 650 K, compressed to 44000 atm and then equilibrated at athmospheric pressure. 
Running input_cooling.lammps run the cooling from 650 to 150 K with simultanious calculation of radius of gyration for each polymer chain.
The results are in temp_GR.dat.
